    - GOOD about bundle size.
    - HIGH maintainability.
    - EASY to scale with low cost
    - SAFE to delivery in production.
    - CLEAN to read and understand in one glance.
    - READY to PLUG and PLAY instead of "Overhaul the codebase".

- ALWAYS use the latest version of the language and tools.
- ALWAYS avoid: 
    - "Magic" and "hardcoded" in codebase.

## Typescript Standards
- ALWAYS avoid using `any`, `unknown`, `never` type, `as` keyword. ALWAYS have type checking and type inference.

## Syntax Standards
- ALWAYS avoid `else` or `else if` syntax, use early return instead.
